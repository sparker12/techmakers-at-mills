# Techmakers
This is a website sample from being a Teaching Assistant for the special topics course _Techmakers_ at Mills College. 


The course description is as follows:
<hr>
With modern technology, everyone has the ability to create digital content. In this course,
students will learn to create interactive websites, mobile phone apps, and art. Students will
understand and explore data analysis and visualization from structured data sources such as the
U.S. Census population data and unstructured data such as social media analysis through
Twitter feeds and trends. Students will also understand and explore the ways that humanities
scholars use thickmapping, the creation of digital archives, and text and image annotation to
conduct historical and literary analysis. Each student in the course will receive an iPad to use for
the course of the semester.
